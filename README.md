# Bitwise-operators

A bitwise operation operates on two-bit patterns of equal lengths by positionally matching their individual bits. For example, a logical AND (&) of each bit pair results in a 1 if both the first AND second bits are 1. If only one bit is a 1, the result is 0. AND can also be used to test individual bits in a bit string to see if they are 0 or 1.

A logical OR (|) operation functions differently from the AND operations. For each bit pair, the result is 1 if the first OR second bit is 1. If neither bit is 1, the result is 0.

A logical XOR (~) of each bit pair results in a 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same (both zeros or both ones).

Logical NOT is represented as ^.

Left shift (<<), right shift (>>) and zero-fill right shift (>>>) bitwise operators are also known as bit shift operators.
